# Image Colorizer - Backend Server

This directory contains the production-ready backend server for the image colorization application.

1. Core Components:
   - main.py: FastAPI server implementation
   - requirements.txt: Python dependencies
   - Image_Colorization_2/: Trained CNN model directory

2. Server Features:
   - FastAPI-based REST API
   - Image processing endpoints
   - CNN model integration
   - CORS support for cross-origin requests

3. File Structure:
   - main.py: Contains all server logic and API endpoints
   - requirements.txt: Lists all required Python packages
   - Image_Colorization_2/: Contains the trained model files
   - Temporary files (my-image.png, result.png) are generated during processing

4. API Endpoints:
   - GET /: Health check endpoint
   - POST /: Image colorization endpoint
     - Accepts base64 encoded images
     - Returns colorized image in base64 format

5. Processing Flow:
   1. Receives image data
   2. Converts to LAB color space
   3. Processes through CNN model
   4. Converts back to RGB
   5. Returns colorized result

Note: Temporary files (my-image.png, result.png) are generated during processing and can be safely deleted.
